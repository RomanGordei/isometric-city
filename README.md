## Traffic & Roads

- Adjacent parallel roads now merge into multi-lane corridors with optional turn pockets and medians.
- Intersections automatically spawn small traffic lights with gentle signal cycles to govern flow.
- Vehicles respect light phases, so the city feels more alive while still keeping the controls simple.
